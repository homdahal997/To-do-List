# React Todo List

## User Interface

The user interface for this React Todo List application builds upon a previous project: a Todo App using JavaScript DOM. For those interested in seeing the evolution of the UI and how it has been adapted and enhanced for React, you can explore the original project here:

[Todo App using JavaScript DOM](https://github.com/homdahal997/SBA-DOM-mytodo-app)

This previous project laid the groundwork for the design and functionality, which has been further refined and integrated into the React ecosystem in the current application.

This project is a simple yet powerful React Todo List application built with Vite. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, providing a smooth and interactive user experience. The application leverages React's efficient update and rendering system, along with additional libraries such as `react-toastify` for notifications, to create a responsive and intuitive interface. In this application, we've efficiently utilized the useReducer, useState, and useEffect hooks

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Users can add new tasks to their todo list.
- **Complete Todos**: Mark tasks as completed to keep track of progress.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Notifications**: Utilizes `react-toastify` for success and error notifications.

### Additional Features
The application uses a third-party API from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com to show four default to-dos when it first loads.
